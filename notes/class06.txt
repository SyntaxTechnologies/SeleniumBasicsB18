### Alerts:

- **Description:**
  - An alert is a popup message that halts interactions until addressed.

- **Types of Alerts:**
  1. **Web-based alerts (HTML):** Can be inspected and actions can be performed.
  2. **JavaScript alerts (Browser):** Managed using the `switchTo` method but cannot be inspected.
  3. **Windows-based alerts:** Not manageable with Selenium.

- **JavaScript Alerts:**
  - **Varieties:**
    1. **Simple Alert:** Click 'OK'.
    2. **Confirmation Alert:** Choose 'Cancel' or 'OK'.
    3. **Prompt Alert:** Provide input, then click 'OK'.

  - **Methods for Handling:**
    - `accept()`: Click 'OK'.
    - `dismiss()`: Click 'Cancel'.
    - `getText()`: Retrieve the alert message.
    - `sendKeys()`: Input text (for prompt alerts).

    Frames:
    Frame is a separate independent window in our webpage
    frames allow devs to represent multiple views on one page

    3 ways to interact with Frames:
    1. by index
    2. by name or ID
    3. by WebElement

    in alerts - switch manually to alert and switch automatically back
    in frames - switch manually to a frame and switch manually back to the main page

    Handling multiple windows:
    In order to handle multiple windows we will be using:
    getWindowHandle()
    getWindowHandles()

    WindowHandle:
    is a unique ID that holds the address of the window or a tab
    It is a alphanumeric character ID
